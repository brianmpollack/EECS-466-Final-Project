# EECS-466-Final-Project
This is the final project for my Computer Graphics class at Case Western Reserve University. We were using OpenGL to learn the basics of computer graphics.

We were required to make a webpage with a description of our project. [Feel free to view here](https://brianmpollack.github.io/EECS-466-Final-Project/project-description.html)
