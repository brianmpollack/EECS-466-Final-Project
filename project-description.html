        <h2>Mesh Simplification</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I implemented a mesh simplification algorithm, originally proposed by Garland and Heckbert, and used it to simplify the helicopter we used in our homework projects.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Mesh representations contain a list of faces that make up an object. Mesh representations can contain hundreds of thousands of faces, or tens of faces depending on how detailed the creator wants to make the meshes.
            Many times a mesh developer wants to <i>reduce</i> a mesh so it can be displayed and used faster. Typically when reducing a mesh, certain faces which are next to each other are combined to a single face. Some time is invested to reduce the mesh but it can then the computer will have a much easier time using it after reduction.
            <br>
            Mesh reduction is especially useful to display objects far away from the screen. It is unnecessary to display a far-away object with great detail as it will be small enough that the user cannot see the details anyway. 
        </p>
        <h3>Prior Work</h3>
        <p>Garland and Heckbert wrote a paper in 1997 describing a mesh reduction algorithm. Their algorithm was efficient, produced high quality results, and could connect regions in the mesh that were close, but not actually connected. They did not provide any source code and I could not find much online about their algorithm except for their paper. I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to implement their algorithm.</p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
            I started with Garland and Heckbert's 1997 paper, Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics. Garland and Heckbert gave a high-level overview of the algorithms used, so I was able to extrapolate from their description and implement them in C++.
            <br>
            The main steps in this algorithm include:
            <ul>
                <li>Compute Q matrices for each vertex - this is the error in the mesh introduced by removing this vertex.</li>
                <li>Select all edges in the mesh</li>
                <li>For each edge, compute the optimal contraction target (the new vertex which would be created if we contract this edge)</li>
                <li>Iteratively contract the lowest cost edge, and update the Q matrices and optimal contraction targets.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I built upon parts of the homework templates we have been using in-class. I used parts of the Mesh Reader and the main OpenGL code in my project.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to implementing mesh reduction, I wanted to display an interesting image on the screen. I used the helicopter we saw in class and animated the blades turning. To do this, I used a program called MeshLab to separate the blades from the body of the helicopter. The body of the helicopter is static but the blades are rotating. The user can pan the camera like in our assignments.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            I implemented the algorithm proposed by Garland and Heckbert. While I did not reach their stated efficiency, I believe that if I used native C data structures (rather than using std::vector, etc.) and implemented a few other performance-improving modifications I would achieve Garland and Heckbert's claimed performance.
        </p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>
            I believe the following modifications could be done to my work:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement multithreading</li>
            <li>Identify boundaries of mesh and preserve all boundaries (rather than simplifying edges which are on a boundary)</li>
            <li>Protect against face inversion (when the normal of the face switches directions)</li>
            <li>Use C data structures (rather than std::vector, etc.) and otherwise improve data structures and memory management</li>
        </ul>
